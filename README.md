# MLproject101
first start learning about Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
Then we start by bit by bit downloading and trainig via python file and also explaining them :)

If you are using windows, use download_datasheet(windows+linux).py else use download_datasheet(Linux).py for better use.

The file train.py trains your model on the files presented and the file final_model.keras and best_model.keras is an example trained model.

Then we predict the files using our trained models and check.py
