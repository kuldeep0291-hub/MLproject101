# MLproject101 – Deepfake Voice Detection Using MFCC and Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

MLproject101 is a machine learning project focused on **detecting deepfake (spoofed) voices** using audio feature extraction and deep learning techniques. The project uses **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)** for feature extraction and a neural network model for classification.

The goal of this project is to classify audio samples as:

* ✅ **Real (Bonafide)**
* ❌ **Fake (Spoofed)**

This project is suitable for beginners who want to learn about audio processing, MFCCs, and applying deep learning to real-world problems.

* NumPy
* Librosa
* Scikit-learn
* KaggleHub

---

## 📦 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuldeep0291-hub/MLproject101.git
cd MLproject101
```

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy librosa scikit-learn kagglehub tqdm soundfile
```

---

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the **ASVspoof 2019 Dataset** for training and evaluation.

### Download Dataset

For Linux:

```bash
python download_linux.py
```

For Windows:

```bash
python download_windows.py
```

Make sure you have your Kaggle API credentials configured properly.

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing

Each audio file is processed as follows:

1. Load audio using Librosa
2. Resample to target sampling rate
3. Apply framing and windowing
4. Extract MFCC features
5. Normalize features
6. Store in NumPy arrays

These features are then used as input to the neural network.

---

## 🚀 Training the Model

To train the model, run:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script will:

* Load and preprocess data
* Split into train/test sets
* Train a neural network
* Save the best model
* Display training metrics

Saved models:

* `best_model.keras`
* `final_model.keras`

---

## 🔍 Model Evaluation

During training, the following metrics are monitored:

* Accuracy
* Loss
* Validation Accuracy
* Validation Loss

You can extend this with:

* Confusion Matrix
* Precision / Recall / F1 Score

---

## 🎯 Making Predictions

To test the model on new audio files:

```bash
python check.py --file path_to_audio.wav
```

Output example:

```
Prediction: REAL
Confidence: 94.2%
```

Supported format: `.wav`

---

## 📈 Sample Results (Example)

| Metric   | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Accuracy | 91%   |
| Loss     | 0.28  |

> Results may vary depending on hardware and dataset split.

---

## 🛠️ Customization

You can modify the following parameters in `train.py`:

* Number of MFCCs
* Learning rate
* Batch size
* Number of epochs
* Model architecture

Example:

```python
EPOCHS = 50
BATCH_SIZE = 32
N_MFCC = 13
```

---

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### 1. Librosa Installation Error

```bash
pip install librosa --upgrade
```

### 2. CUDA / GPU Not Detected

Make sure you have installed:

* CUDA Toolkit
* cuDNN
* Compatible TensorFlow version

Check with:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))
```

### 3. Dataset Not Found

Ensure dataset path is correct in scripts.
